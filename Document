Program Explanation:
  Class 'Block':
    Class that contains the features of block in Tetris. Block has its x and y position, block number that determines the shape of the block among 7 types of block,
    rotation number that determines how many times the block is rotated, and shape that will store the shape of the block.
    
  Class 'Board':
    Class that stores the current situation during the game runs. Everytime the block is falled down to the end, the block is stored in the member variable Table[][].
    
  Class 'Score':
  
  Class 'Rules':
    Class 'Rules' is inheriting the class 'Block', 'Board', and 'Score' (Class 'Score' is not yet implemented). It basically contains the system of Tetris
    regarding the base classes.

  The things that I had missed are rotation. When block is rotated, its shape is changed. For example, let's say l-shaped block is located in the right end
  and it is about to be rotated. It will penetrate the wall. To
